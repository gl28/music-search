      "Compressing reviewId 22045 with content From the moment Prince’s party ran out of time and the ball dropped in Times Square to signal a new millennium, people were waiting. They were waiting in the wee moments of the new year for ominous, Y2K catastrophe to hit, for worldwide web grids to collapse, for large scale chaos of another order to afflict the globe. That the calamity didn’t drop in the form of a Roland Emmerich summer blockbuster sparked an initial sigh of relief. But the phenomenon of collective waiting—to see whether the recent impeachment of a president would lead to the end of the Clinton good-times era, to see whether the courts would order the family of six-year-old Elian Gonzalez to return him to Cuba across the Cold War divide, to see whether the officers who fired 41 shots into unarmed African immigrant Amadou Diallo would do any time at all, to see whether hanging chads would tip the balance of a presidential election—all that waiting would roll out across the entire year in waves of succession. Long spells of anxiety and watchfulness would punctuate the year 2000, a pivotal period that sometimes gets lost in the shuffle when trying to pinpoint the origins of new millennium unrest and epic uncertainty.When she stepped into New York’s historic Electric Lady studios in 1999 and began recording her much-anticipated sophomore album, Erykah Badu had her finger to the wind. The tracks she was laying down extended what had quickly become her trademark vibe: that of deep-groove tarrying, wrestling with time, pushing up against and pulling at the beat but also lingering in the pocket while delivering pithy observations about temporal lag and the will to move. Her music brimmed with the suggestion—albeit a conflicted one—to wait for it. “On & On,” Badu’s breakthrough single from her 1997 smash debut Baduizm, became an anthem for this kind of indelible, cool-breeze, fitfulness. “Oh my my my I’m feeling high,” she sings with the distinct horn-like phrasings that brought Billie Holiday comparisons, “my money’s gone, I’m all alone/The world keeps turning…” It all came together in Badu’s sound and style: the image of a sister who couldn’t be bothered, who couldn’t care less about the time (“I think I need a cup of tea…”), yet who simultaneously recognized and paid reverence to black time, that which is past and that which is still to come. Her many references to the Five Percent Nation and Afrocentric cosmologies on Baduizm announced the arrival of new black nationalist soul, steeped in astrologically configured wisdom (“My cypher keeps moving like a rolling stone”) and headed toward an Afrofuturist destination to be determined.To be rooted in the here and now while also resolutely and speculatively elsewhere—this was Erykah Badu’s distinct gambit early in her career. But Mama’s Gun turned an important page as she set out to pair songs that evoked the art of exquisite and romantically-charged lingering and hanging (the “urban hang suite,” as Maxwell would call it on his own debut album from 1996) alongside songs about being fed up with stasis, isolation, restriction and aborted dreams. In contrast to Baduizm, Mama’s Gun offers a more pointed, sustained, and grounded statement about what it means to get tired of waiting out and wading through the wretchedness of urban blight, the perpetual threat of police brutality and lethal force, the baggage from bad relationships and the sometimes oppressive voices inside one’s own head.Those voices open the record’s first side in a cacophony of whispers as Badu admonishes herself about a laundry-list of unfinished tasks, nagging fears, and floating enigmas swirling through her mind (“I have to write a song… I have to remember to turn on the oven… warm up the apartment… Malcolm… Malcolm… I need to take my vitamin”). What cuts through the noise is a burst of sonic muscle—pure soul energy compressed into 10 initial seconds: the joyful ensemble (Chinah Blac and YahZarah) bellowing in Rufus-meets-Brand New Heavies unison as longtime collaborators Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson on drums, James Poyser on piano, Pino Palladino on bass, and Jeff Lee Johnson on guitar lay down a robust opening riff that sounds definitive and defiant. The opening moments of Mama’s Gun sound much less like anything off of Badu’s first record and instead resonate unmistakably in the vein of two other releases from earlier that year, Common’s fourth studio album, Like Water for Chocolate, and D’Angelo’s game-changing Voodoo. All three albums were recorded simultaneously at Electric Lady. All three benefitted from the skilled hand of legendary engineer Russell Elevado, who mixed each LP and drew on vintage recording techniques to evoke the ghosts of venerable albums past. And most crucially, all three featured MVP player Questlove acting improvisationally at the center of an alternative black pop universe at the turn of the millennium, one with clearly nostalgic tenets that nonetheless held fast to present communal concerns and future Wonder-inflected aspirations.This was neo soul at arguably its most prolific and thrilling moment of growth and possibility. Innovated by black Gen-Xers who ardently valued and sought to revive their parents’ and their older siblings’ music and the albums that soundtracked their childhood, neo soul runs best on a seductive combination of cultural nostalgia, black solidarity dreams, and the will to couple sensually with an ideal partner while paying attention (somewhat but not always) to the politics of gender equality. And the list of remarkable artists who broke onto the scene alongside of Badu working this sound in the year of and leading up to 2000 underscores what a busy, passionate, and productive time it was.From 1993, when Me’shell NdegéOcello stepped out ahead of everyone with Plantation Lullabies on Madonna’s Maverick label to D’Angelo’s 1995 first effort Brown Sugar (often erroneously referred to as the first in the genre) a year later to Maxwell’s debut (Urban Hang Suite) to Lauryn Hill’s insta-classic Miseducation in ’98 to oddball soulster Macy Gray’s one-hit smash On How Life Is in ’99, to the year 2000 when Jill Scott made her first LP (Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Volume I), these were exciting times when black singer-songwriter musicians were referencing Black Panther memoirs, African-American Studies history books, and deep cuts from reluctant soul icons like Bill Withers. In the days after Voodoo dropped into the world, New York Times critic Ben Ratliff would famously describe the genre as “a mature music, and a family music, for living rooms, rather than for the streets.”“Penitentiary Philosophy,” the charging, opening track on Mama’s Gun pulls all of these ambitions together. Bursting with the energy and the righteous discontent of King’s letter from a Birmingham jail (in which he declared to the world “why we can’t wait” for liberation), it recalls the sonic palette of Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic while venturing further down the road of trenchant social critique that Badu had already begun to walk on Baduizm’s “Other Side of the Game,” her third single off of that album and one that planted her firmly in the run of socially-conscious hip-hop culture. With its looped sample of Stevie’s “Ordinary Pain,” “Penitentiary Philosophy” stays focused on the perils and corrosive effects of streets that don’t love you, streets that can trap you. “Here’s my philosophy/Livin’ in a penitentiary…” she declares, dropping verses like Gil Scott-Heron, “Brothers all on the corner/Tryin’ to make believe/Turn around ain’t got no pot to pee/Make me mad when I see you sad… you can’t win when your will is weak/When you’re knocked on the ground….” In the same year that David Simon dropped “The Corner” and two years before his masterpiece “The Wire,” Badu was still singing about the effects of the game from a woman’s point of view (something Simon’s shows were often, at best, half-assed about doing). Still the caring sister who observes the ensuing crisis from the sidelines, Badu has morphed on this track out of the role of devoted bystander into full-scale Last Poet.Badu gently admonishes her listeners to get to going, drawing on the Brixton trans-Atlantic migratory sound of Soul II Soul on “Time’s a Wastin,” a “Keep On Movin’”-style new-millennium anthem and something of a partner song to “Penitentiary Philosophy” that warns against drifting and advises listeners to “Make your money last/Learn from your past…. Don’t take your time, young man…” The brothers who are lost, the brothers who can’t find their way in an “oh-so-strange world” remain near and dear to Badu’s heart, and she offers them visions of the beautiful journey that awaits them, one that can change and restore their hope because “oh baby we need to smile…” Badu is no prophetess or preacher like her counterpart Hill, but she leans into this song’s alluring keyboard arrangement which, at the bridge, evokes the sound of the “incidental” church organ, what black studies critic Ashon Crawley brilliantly refers to as “nothing music,” the music of the organist doodling and improvising underneath the riffing of the deacon or the pastor or the volunteer bake sale representative. It’s the sound of sitting in the sanctuary together and having frank and easy conversations with one another as she wistfully warns of a future without a plan (“Ain’t no tellin where you’ll land…”).The Badu of hope, headwraps, and incense is still very much present on this record, voicing anthems about correcting one’s path and questing on tracks like “Didn’t Cha Know” and the sequel jam, “… & On.” The former track wraps itself around a hypnotic sample from New York-based fusion jazz-funk ensemble Tarika Blue’s 1977 “Dreamflower” record, a Badu obsession that she discovered while crate-digging, at the behest of J Dilla, through his extraordinary collection. Badu rides the chillout vibe of this song in the face of despair (“Think I made a wrong turn back there somewhere/Didn’t cha know, didn’t cha know/Knew the toll, but I would not pay…”). In the Oprahfied age of black female self-help narratives led by Iyanla Vanzant and novelist Terry McMillan, she continued her rise as an icon of black bohemian positivity (“Free your mind and find your way/There will be a brighter day”). What set her apart from other neo-soul women of this era was her unabashedly quirky, black hippie stance which she kicks into high gear throughout “…& On,” spinning like the earth on its axis like a “Gypsy/Flippin’ life game from the right brain/Ascension maintained/Rolling through like a burning flame…” Badu’s rhymes summon the sound and feeling of late 1990s Nuyorican Café poetry slams and basement club, late night jazz improv.For sure, some of the album’s metaphors flirt with cabaret cliché. Badu got flack from some critics for the beatnik flute and cosmic references on “Orange Moon.” But the thread that ties these tracks together is the flow that is freedom—freedom to pursue new love (on “In Love With You,” a birds-tweeting, Spanish-inflected guitar ballad that finds Badu doing her best Deniece Williams impression and in duet with Stephen Marley), freedom to pursue pleasure (“Kiss Me on My Neck (Hesi)”) for herself. It’s a distinct kind of liberation from that of Lauryn’s redemption song sermons, Me’shell’s brooding tales of struggle and conflict, and even Jill Scott’s earnest Black Arts era feminist poetry.Ironically, it is Mary J to whom she most clearly pays homage on the aptly titled “My Life,” which swings with the hip-hop soul queen’s b-girl cadences. With its Puffy-designed excess and materialism, hip-hop soul was always at odds with the political earthiness of the neo bunch. Yet the bounce on this track clearly echoes that of the Yonkers R&B diva’s album of the same name. Here in Badu’s version of “My Life,” as on other tracks, she stalls to figure out a plan (“Standing downtown… tryin to figure out a way up out of this town”) and vows that “one day” she’ll be “flyin’ high.” Songs of strength and self-worth like her “Cleva” chronicle a moment when artists like India.Arie were using their music to reject Eurocentric beauty standards in pop (on 2000’s “Video Girl”) and megastars TLC were waxing contemplative about self love rather than outer beauty (on their 1999 track “Unpretty”).But Badu would consistently put her own bold and wickedly sharp twist on such themes. “This is how I look without makeup/And with no bra my ninny’s sag down,” she sings on “Cleva,” sounding like a modern day Moms Mabley. Badu lifts the boast and braggadocio so clearly associated with hip-hop MCs of both genders and turns it into the language of the R&B goddess, a lesson that one Texas-bred superstar would follow and master as the ’00s would further unfold. Badu is by far the slyest and most playful wordsmith of the neosoulsters as is evident on her brilliant feminist critique, “Booty,” the fierce, signifying answer to NdegéOcello’s bellicose (and casually mean-spirited) “If That’s Your Boyfriend (He Wasn’t Last Night).” Backed by a horn section doing its best take on the Quincy Jones-circa 1972-black sitcom theme song sound, “Booty”’s I don’t-want-to-fight-you resolve still stands out in a sea of pop songs across this (and last) century cataloguing lost-my-man, you-can’t-have-my-man, and give-me-back-my-man crises. It’s a song that also eschews woman vs. woman “bad blood” posturing in favor of extolling shrewd observations about the crazy things patriarchy makes women do to each other.It’s a singular feminist statement on the album topped only by Mama’s Gun’s first single and accompanying video for the track “Bag Lady,” arguably the first pop song by an African-American musician to overtly engage tropes and images from a classic work of black women’s literature. In loving tribute to Ntozake Shange’s 1975 pathbreaking choreopoem drama For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf, the video for “Bag Lady” re-stages signature scenes and images from the play as the song revisits its major themes of self-love, self-discovery, unrequited love, gender conflict and communication, emotional and psychological bruising, failure, redemption, and personal fulfillment for black women. Produced and directed by Badu, the clip, “a poemeography by Erykah Badu,” features five women (as opposed to seven in Shange’s play) who represent the colors of the rainbow. Badu, the Lady in Red, begins by literally breaking out of the wide-screen cinematic format and moves in the next scene with our five “colored” women, strolling the streets together before ending up in the enclosed space of the classroom, a constricted site in more ways than one since it’s here that, as Badu sings “I guess nobody every told you/All you must hold on to/Is you/Is you/Is you!”The inadequacies of institutional education—it’s inability to address the specific needs and concerns of black women—are put on blast as each “colored woman” shrugs her shoulders to the beat of Elevado’s mix and Badu’s own deft production. To the church they head for a spiritual revival to “let it go, let it go, let it go.” Badu’s Red Lady advises her sisteren to “pack light”—let go of the harmful elements of the past--or else “you gon’ miss your bus.” It’s a song that contemplates how to not let the baggage weigh you down and make you wait, and it offers a way forward for women of color (many colors here) by way of a text from the bygone 1970s black feminist renaissance era.Like Hill and her sometime Soulquarian sister Scott in particular, Erykah Badu was not willing, on Mama’s Gun, to sacrifice extolling narratives of black feminist self-care for ones that exposed black communal peril, trauma, and tragedy. “A.D. 2000,” her broken-hearted yet clear-eyed elegy for Amadou Diallo is, in fact, a song that weaves together the profound sadness arising out of the recognition about how little black life matters in American culture. In the wake of the acquittal of the four plain-clothed police officers who took Diallo’s life, Badu sings a song for him (A.D.) and for the after-death era, one in which no monuments will mark the passing of those who were killed by the hands of the state. Thirteen years before Bay Area community organizer Alicia Garza would lament the chronic disregard for the slaughter of black life and, with her fellow queer black feminist activists, create a hashtag that subsequently ignited a global movement, Badu recorded a dirge for the newly-woke age of no justice. That she did so while enlisting soul legend Betty “Clean Up Woman” Wright to contribute vocals drives home the ways that she yokes together gender solidarity and black uplift politics in the 2.0 version of her career.At its core, Mama’s Gun is an album that understands just how essential black love is to any movement to fight the power, and it also recognizes just how expensive it is to lose it. Badu went through a high profile break-up with Outkast’s Andre “3000” Benjamin, the father of her first child, as she began to work on the album. In the wake of the split, she penned the aching, Chaka Khan-inflected epic that closes the record, the 10-minute “Green Eyes,” which moves through several different suites that capture the many moods of a relationship coming to an end. Opening with a nod to Lady Day-era jazz vocalizing, “Green Eyes” crackles with the sound of vinyl as Badu croons a torch song lament that rolls with fits and starts through jealousy, fear, resignation, regret, resolution. We move with her as she travels the abyss of her unbearable “growing pains.” It is a song that underscores the fact that, more than a decade before Queen Yoncé, Erykah Badu laid down the blueprint for a black feminist album that went well beyond documenting tales of heartbreak to address issues greater than the sum of any one relationship. She made a record that wore its awareness of the larger traumas and challenges that complicate human intimacy on its sleeves. It was music for the revolution that wasn’t televised.\n",

      "Compressing reviewId 22044 with content On the night of November 14, 1991, 500 million people scattered across 27 nations simultaneously watched Michael Jackson grab his crotch 17 times. He simulated masturbation, shattered car windows with crowbars, and unleashed the primal screams expected from a man who owned publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue. Then he turned into a black panther. The video ends with Bart Simpson striking a B-Boy pose in a Michael Jackson shirt, and ordering Homer to “chill out, homeboy.” It shattered all previous viewing records on Fox.The $4 million, 11-minute unedited telecast of “Black or White” ranks among the Smithsonian-worthy artifacts of ’90s pop monoculture—up there with Nirvana trashing their instruments at the ’92 VMAs, the premiere of “Summertime” after The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Hillary Clinton hitting the Macarena at the ’96 DNC. No one ever had more juice than Jackson did at the time, and it’s difficult to imagine that anyone ever will again.This was right around the time when they named him an official king of the Ivory Coast. In Gabon, 100,000 greeted him with signs reading “Welcome Home, Michael.” His universal popularity was on par with pizza and the polio vaccine. Safe enough to be Captain EO at Disneyland, hood-certified enough to throw up the set with the Crips.The 33-year-old had recently signed the most lucrative contract in recording history, worth hundreds of millions, giving him his own label and the highest royalty rate in the industry. What’s more, no one thought it was out of line for someone who had sold close to 70 million records in the previous decade. In the press, Sony claimed the deal would reap them billions.So when he released the first single from Dangerous, his first album in four years, fanatical interest led MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox to televise it at the same time—offering the greatest strategic victory since the Berlin Wall tumbled two years prior. And even though Jackson technically didn’t cause the collapse of East German Communism, his star wattage was so supreme that the Stasi secret police spied on him during his 1988 Berlin concert, fearing that obsessive MJ fans would accomplish what Reagan couldn’t.With “Black or White,” Jackson lashed out at his public perception. In the interim since 1987’s Bad, he’d grappled with both outlandish rumors (buying the Elephant Man’s bones, sleeping in a hyperbaric chamber) and some that drew blood (allegations of bleaching his skin). The innocent popcorn-eating Michael of Thriller was gone, but calling him “Wacko Jacko” was slander. He wanted us to know he was a man, an eccentric sure, but an adult with deeply rooted beliefs.Released only five months before the LA Riots, the Rodney King beating and murder of Latasha Harlins almost certainly factored into Jackson’s increasingly political slant. “Black or White” articulated a utopian vision of a post-racial future while acknowledging the sins of contemporary bigotry.  He demands equality, shouting that he “ain’t second to none.” He growls, “I ain’t scared of no sheets” (presumably Klansmen). Its hook offers his dream of a color-blind society, echoing Martin Luther King.But this was Michael Jackson, not O’ Shea. Being King of Pop meant the need for mass appeal. The “Black or White” video exists as a microcosm of Dangerous itself. It potently affirms Jackson’s manhood, offers passionate screeds against racial strife, gang violence, and a parasitic American media. This is the album as multi-media spectacle, a precursor to Lemonade, with accusations of infidelity substituted for videos of Macaulay Culkin doing air guitar windmills to a Slash guitar solo and lip sync rapping about turf wars.The lone #1 single from the 32-million selling Dangerous, “Black or White” spent seven weeks atop the Billboard charts. Directed by John Landis (“Thriller,” National Lampoon’s Animal House) the first quarter of its video reveals Jackson’s mischievous child-like streak, with Culkin towing out Spinal Tap-sized speakers, amplifying the volume to “ARE YOU NUTS!?!,” and shredding so hard that George Wendt gets ejected into the stratosphere screaming “Da Bears.”It blends into his idealistic visionary side that wanted to heal the world through philanthropy and moonwalking. There is pop locking with Balinese dancers, rain dances with Native Americans, folk dances in front of the Kremlin, and the serenade of a Hindu goddess on a freeway. This is the magical Michael Jackson of our early memories—the man with the graceful dance moves and lithe falsetto that seemed celestially ordained (masking a notoriously intense perfectionist streak). Faces of all races harmoniously morph into one another, the most cutting edge FX that 1991 had to offer.In the third section, boy becomes man: Jackson struts through a wall of flames, Henley shirt open, screaming at his enemies like a mad king. It gives way to Culkin rapping in shades and oversized gold chains, which is just as well considering that this is the man who actually spit the bars. Jackson’s embrace of hip-hop not only aligned him with the popular sound of black (and white) youth culture, it adds an aggressive masculinity unseen in his catalogue, and ultimately paved the way for the late period Biggie therapy session.Of course, in the final section, Jackson turns into a black panther. You understand that meaning. So did millions of parents in Tipper Gore America, who flooded Fox and its local affiliates with phone calls, forcing Jackson’s team to re-cut and sanitize the video.A quarter century later, it seems absurd that Michael Jackson smashing a few windows before turning into a Jungle Book character could be cause for mass protest, but you have to remember how adored and family-friendly Michael Jackson was. My parents only owned two records: Thriller and Bad. So until I was 9 years old, I listened to those two almost every single day of my life, and honestly I didn’t really need anything else. Michael Jackson was my entire conception of music. Millions more could say the same thing.So when he dropped “Black or White,” it was shocking. If he was previously pop’s Peter Pan figure, Jackson had suddenly adopted a more carnal streak, but even here it was cartoonish. If the adult world looked dull and stifling, Jackson’s imagination offered a hope that it was possible not to wind up like George Wendt, bloated on a couch with a bored housewife. You could hang out with Macaulay Culkin, dance on top of the Statue of Liberty, and if all else failed, you could transform into a panther and bounce.* * *Imagine being Teddy Riley in 1991. You’ve gone from humble origins in Harlem to inventing New Jack Swing; you've produced multiple hits for your own band Guy, Bobby Brown, and Keith Sweat (“I Want Her”). Then late one night, you get a phone call from Michael Jackson telling you that he needs you to produce his new album—in effect making you the new Quincy Jones. All before your 24th birthday.Before Riley headed west, Jackson had labored on Dangerous for over a year to varying degrees of success. Something always seemed off. Bad might have been the last album before hip-hop became the de facto soundtrack of urban culture. 1988 changed everything. Public Enemy, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane left the competition sounding effete and timid. Gang wars and the crack epidemic continued to inflame inner cities. Songs like “Smooth Criminal” seemed obsolete. Meanwhile Jackson’s sister Janet had recently delivered a hard-stomping R&B-pop classic in 1989’s Rhythm Nation 1814. Its influence on her older brother was so great that he even asked Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis to produce Dangerous. Out of loyalty to Janet, they turned him down. According to his engineer, Bruce Swedien, Michael was searching for something “very street that young people would be able to identify with.”He wasn’t alone. His longtime competition Prince sought to re-connect in a similar fashion, forming the New Power Generation with rapper, Tony M. Released just one month before Dangerous, the purple one’s Diamonds and Pearls exists as a companion piece, documents of blurring eras. As ’80s pop gave way to ’90s hip-hop, they sought to find their place in the re-configured landscape. Except while Prince predictably constructed his own insular unit, Jackson looked outwards to Riley, the hottest producer of the moment.If that seems obvious today, it wasn’t at the start of 1991. Many mainstream artists still saw hip-hop as a passing fad or stereotyped it as nihilistic and violent. Jackson needed to walk the fine line between disposable bubblegum rap like Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer, and alienating longtime disciples with something too radical.After preparing grooves in Q-Tip’s Soundtrack Studio in Queens, Riley flew out to the Neverland Ranch to meet the master. There was a tour of the trophy room, the carousel, and the zoo, and then after they talked late into the night, Jackson put Riley on his personal helicopter and had him flown to the Universal City Hilton, a short distance from the San Fernando Valley studios where they recorded Dangerous. Riley began work the next day.Jackson established nerve centers at Record One and Larrabee Studios, just a few miles down Ventura Blvd. The latter had the SSL mixing console that Riley needed to make the tracks slap, and despite his pop reputation, Jackson wanted his new songs as hard as humanly possible. Engineers remember Jackson demanding that they play the New Jack Swing songs so loud that your ears bled. He invariably blew up a pair of headphones each session.As you’d expect, the recording process boasted its requisite share of idiosyncrasy. Nancy Reagan visited the studio once, requiring the Secret Service to search the place for hours prior to her visit. Brooke Shields called frequently to talk to Michael, who materialized every day in the same black dress pants and red button-down shirt (he had a clothing rack of just two items).One night, he left early to go to Tower Records, which had been shut down just for him to spend $1,500 on CDs. Another afternoon, he ordered several $900 remote controlled motorcycles brought to the studio. Despite usually eating meals prepared by a personal chef, Jackson requested McDonald’s for lunch on one occasion. He’d never actually eaten there before, but someone told him it was good, so he ordered one of everything on the menu and took a small bite of each. (The fish sandwich particularly wowed him.)Then there was Madonna. During March and April of 1991, Jackson and Madonna went out to dinner at least three times, which led tabloids to immediately report that they were dating. During these conversations, Jackson reportedly asked her to duet on the unfinished version of what became, “In the Closet.”“I think all he wanted was a provocative title, and ultimately he didn’t want the content of the song to live up to the title,” Madonna said at the time. “I said, ‘Look, Michael, if you want to do something with me, you have to be willing to go all the way or I’m not going to do it.’”His engineers remember her visiting him once at the studio, where they spent a little time in his private room in the back. “When I asked Michael later about her visit he said that she ‘scared’ him,” his engineer Rob Disner later said. “I think we all speculated that she tried to make a ‘move’ on him but Michael never said. In any event, we never saw her again.”The creative union most likely fizzled due to major stylistic divergences. Madonna imagined an extreme makeover: giving him a Caesar haircut, getting him out of his bedazzled military uniforms, taking him to New York and hanging out with the voguers, House of Xtravaganza. Michael wanted to go hip-hop and ultimately enlisted rappers Heavy D and Aqil Davidson of Wreckx N’ Effect as the principal guest vocalists.During the summer of ’91, competition broke out within the two studios and three rooms dedicated to Dangerous. At Record One, Bill Bottrell and Bruce Swedien worked on the album’s softer more adult contemporary material (and “Black or White”). At Larrabee, Riley handled the New Jack Swing half. Even though engineers remember the sessions as “giggly, innocent, and so much fun,” Jackson did his part to foster a friendly rivalry—bouncing back and forth between studios and taunting his teams, “Oh boy, they got some smelly jelly going on in there.”As Sony’s deadlines kept getting blown, Riley’s beats began forming the spine of the record. After being initially awestruck, Riley asserted more and more control at Jackson’s behest. “It worked itself out when he shook me,” Riley told HipHopWired in 2009. “[He was like] listen, you’re going to have to really produce me like you’ve produced a new artist. I need you to talk to me, I need you to criticize me, I need you to comment, I need you to give me all of you. I want the Teddy Riley that got that record out of Guy and the records out of your previous artists.”If Michael danced in the studio, it meant that a track sounded right. No matter what, Jackson ensured that the melodies were his own, while Riley sought to merge his trademark New Jack Swing with Quincy Jones’ baroque pop. At one point, L.A. Reid and Babyface were brought in to help produce, but none of their contributions made the final cut. Over 60 songs wound up being written over a period of 18 months. It cost $10 million in total, not counting video costs.When Jackson revealed the final tracklist to Riley, the latter expected to see his name once or twice. Instead, Riley produced six of the 14 songs—arguably all the material that has aged the best. As a result of his contributions, you can convincingly argue that Dangerous is Jackson’s final classic album and the best full-length of the New Jack Swing era.As soon as you pressed play on the tape, Riley’s drums attacked with Scud-era force. “Jam.” The sound of glass breaking, bells reminiscent of LL Cool J’s “Jingling Baby,” funky drums that knock like Clyde Stubblefield was behind the kit, and roaring saxophone licks. The words “you want to get up and jam” are initially buried in the mix, but the vocals are as acrobatic as a highlight reel, so it only made sense that the Chicago Bulls used it in their 1992 championship video. Starring Michael Jordan and Kris Kross, the “Jam” clip became almost as iconic as “Black or White.” Filmed in an abandoned rat-infested armory on the South Side of Chicago, it finds Michael Jackson teaching Jordan how to dance and the other MJ teaching him to hoop. Through the wonders of special effects, Jackson ultimately swishes shots that not even Steph Curry can hit; but not even the greatest dancer of the last half-century can teach Jordan how to dance. Point Jackson.Riley recruited Jackson’s favorite rapper Heavy D for four nimble bars, his baritone artfully offsetting the singer’s falsetto growl. The first song wastes no time in articulating the album’s leitmotif. Jackson urges the world to come together, decries false prophets crying of doom, and admits that the universe is a complicated place full of “tears for fears.” He’s “conditioned by the system” and doesn’t want to be preached to. His ultimate realization is that you have to “live each day like it’s the last,” find inner peace to stay strong against the haters, and when in doubt, jam.You can see these themes stressed on nearly every song. “Why You Wanna Trip on Me” exists as a mission statement. This is the Michael who fame has isolated and forced into retreat. There’s a newfound menace in his voice, an angelic sneer, as he recites a litany of crippling ailments (world hunger, illiteracy, disease, gangs, homelessness, drug addiction, corruption, police brutality)—and yet ironically, he has somehow become the media’s bullseye. Written during his 33rd year, Jackson can’t help but implicitly compare himself to Jesus—a popular healer who wants to help, misinterpreted and publicly crucified.  But even though Teddy Riley had Jesus, Jesus never had Teddy Riley. These drums could turn stone walls to white sand, the vocals are meticulously layered, the multiple bridges leave just enough room for interpretative dance moves. Jackson adapts seamlessly to the new genre, funkier than Guy, more lyrically incisive than Bobby Brown.Without Madonna, “In the Closet” received a cameo from Princess Stephanie of Monaco, mainly because Michael liked her sultry speaking voice even though she couldn’t sing. Shot in the desert, the Herb Ritts video stars Naomi Campbell at her pret a porter peak. Michael wears a tank top with a plunging neckline. It’s probably the most erotically charged of his career, about as far from “Thriller” as Basic Instinct is to The Mask.  You can trace Timbaland and the Neptunes experiments to a song like “She Drives Me Wild,” in which their former mentor created the percussion tracks from automotive sounds: car horns, motorcycles idling and revving, vehicles starting and screeching. This is probably Jackson’s closest attempt to match his sister’s Rhythm Nation.Some interpreted it as a desire to catch up, but it’s more emblematic of his lust to conquer. If Off the Wall was Jackson mastering late ’70s soul and disco, Thriller was his perfection of ’80s pop. This is Jackson showing that he could blend hip-hop and R&B better than anyone had previously imagined. The new decade starts here, with artists like Mary J. Blige, Jodeci, TLC, R. Kelly, et al. taking cues from Jackson and Riley’s alchemy. To say nothing of Kanye, Drake, and countless others still atop the charts.Dangerous has its flaws. The ballads on the back (non-Riley) half of the album could pass for gospel renditions of Celine Dion schmaltz. Despite its noble message and Jackson’s statement that it was the song he was most proud of writing, “Heal the World” is essentially “We Are The World Pt. 2.” The theme from Free Willy, “Will You Be There” offers a sweet sentiment, but it’s not exactly “I Believe I Can Fly.” “Gone Too Soon” falls into that same category of beautifully intentioned crooning that ultimately sounds like a dentist office doxology, especially when contrasted with the brilliant funk of the first side.If nothing else, they display the full range of his sharply targeted social consciousness, one that encompassed environmentalism, the AIDS pandemic, and every other affliction that still plagues the globe. In that sense, Dangerous might be Jackson’s most complete album, spanning dance music to dark nights of the soul. It’s a portrait of a persecuted genius, desperate to stay relevant, burdened with guilt and rage, lashing out at villains and offering inspiration to allies—always making it seem effortless.  * * *My favorite song on Dangerous is “Remember the Time.” Like so many others on this album, it’s inextricable from its video, which also received the MJ treatment: simultaneous premieres on MTV, Fox and BET in February of 1992. Directed by John Singleton, it stars Eddie Murphy, Iman, the Pharcyde, Magic Johnson, Tiny Lister, and some adorable striped tabbies. It’s probably the only song from Dangerous that can still go off in any club on any given night.As far as I’m concerned, it’s the greatest music video ever made, a New Jack Swing hybrid of Cleopatra and Indiana Jones. There are swirling hourglasses, busts of Pharaohs, hand drums, wriggling snakes, and Michael Jackson as a gilded wizard with dance moves so smooth that he can even elude the future Deebo. He’s so cool that steals the Pharaoh’s wife (who also happens to be David Bowie’s future wife) and then disappears into a cloud of gold dust, just as his capture seems imminent.Being a child of the ’80s and ’90s meant that Magic Johnson, Eddie Murphy, and Michael Jordan were your heroes. (Maybe you liked Larry Bird or something, but I assume if that’s the case, you’ve long stopped reading this review.) And in his videos, Michael Jackson managed to best them all, making him the undisputed King. For most of my pre-adolescence, he was a pure sorcerer, a demigod immune to the gravitational pull and perimeters that stifle the rest of us.At 10 years old, I assumed the video was shot somewhere in Egypt, because even though I no longer believed in bullshit like Santa Claus, I still accepted Michael Jackson at face value. Besides, nothing else he did seemed like it operated under any budgetary constraint. Only about a year ago did I learn that it was shot at Mack Sennett Studios in Silver Lake, a soundstage across the street from my apartment that I’d obliviously walked past thousands of times. It was one of those depressing realizations that makes much less sense than believing that Michael Jackson built a time machine and brought the star of Beverly Hills Cop, a supermodel, and the best point guard ever, along with him to the time of Ramses the Great. Watch that video again and tell me otherwise.In that same way, it’s difficult to listen to Dangerous without considering the child molestation allegations that greeted him shortly after he came home from its marathon 69-concert tour. It’s tricky not to read too much into a song like “In the Closet.” How do you reconcile that someone as pure of spirit as Jackson could potentially have a monstrous streak?Whether you believe the allegations or not, it’s clear that he was never the same after Dangerous. The damage became too absolute, the vitriol aimed his way too severe for someone that sensitive. Never again could his music exist on its own merits, the illimitable genius ravaged by prescription pills, insomnia, and obliterating pressure. Dangerous is the last time that Michael Jackson was Michael Jackson.In an interview given shortly after the release of Dangerous, Jackson said that his goal was to do “an album that was like Tchaikovsky’s ‘Nutcracker Suite.’ In a thousand years from now, people would still be listening to it…. Something that would live forever.” He’s been gone for over half a decade, but I still think about this quote every time I walk past that sound stage—considering the possibilities that Michael Jackson unlocked in every song, the infinite magic that he could create out of an empty room, the orphic visions of one of our final myths.  \n",

      "Compressing reviewId 20257 with content Estelle’s latest record True Romance offers something new in the singer's career: a cohesive album experience. The follow-up to 2012’s All of Me is a chronicle of love anchored by four themes—\"passion, courage, bullshit, and true romance\"—though it sticks to this blueprint at the risk of losing some of the idiosyncrasy that gave her previous works character. All of Me and her debut album Shine incorporated many different elements—Estelle experimented with rapping, boom-bap, reggae. Her song with Kanye West, \"American Boy\", went double platinum before garnering a Grammy for \"Best Rap/Sung\" collaboration. Together, the albums featured beats by will.i.am, Mark Ronson, Wyclef Jean, and Swizz Beatz, and guest appearances from Rick Ross, Janelle Monáe, and Trey Songz. The patchwork of styles made each album feel scattered and disjointed, but enjoyable.True Romance instead finds Estelle hewing a narrative, singing about passion and healing with the kind of focus and intimacy that all neo-soul ballads require. It’s a decidedly inward-looking album, but as such seems too aspirational for its own good: Estelle narrates her experiences, and hovers so closely to the outline that it feels like we're checking boxes rather than happening upon these themes organically. Spoken word intros break the album up into loose chapters: Estelle says the word \"passion\" and we hear a song about romantic ardor (\"Something Good\"); she mutters the word \"bullshit\" and we hear a song about a troubled love (\"The Same\")—but neither of these songs have the playful immediacy of Shine’s \"American Boy\" or the inchoate longing of All of Me-standout \"Thank You\". There are many feel-good hooks and lilting choruses on True Romance, but the album is so universal in its approach (\"We all make mistakes/ You might fall on your face,\" she sings on \"Conqueror\") that it can feel anesthetic. As a result, there’s nothing about True Romance that rings with the feeling of \"passion, courage, bullshit, or true romance.\" It’s difficult to make inspirational pop music with personality, and harder still to mold a voice as dynamic as Estelle’s to fit a template—so when the personal stakes don't seem high enough, the message falls flat. Still, True Romance is less busy than any of Estelle’s previous works, and it shifts the emphasis away from crafty lyricism to vocals and nuanced production. Throughout True Romance Estelle’s voice moves in velvety cascades, ribboning through melismas with muted precision. She adopts a honeyed rasp on \"Time Share\" and coos across a smoky dancehall on \"Not Sure\"; she speak-sings through \"She Will Love\" and lowers her range amongst Turkish cymbals on \"Fight For It\". Album standout \"Something Good\", meanwhile, showcases an infectious candor in which Estelle sounds a good deal like Mary J. Blige, belting upper-register refrains over a stammering house beat. The step-wise thrum of \"Something Good\" makes me think about the kind of sound Mary J. Blige was striving for in her work with Disclosure—and it complements Estelle’s voice enough to make you wish she pursued electronic music further on the rest of the album.Instead, True Romance is preoccupied with the well-worn territory of soul-pop, and its lyrics about overcoming obstacles and troubled relationships can often sound rote (see: \"Gotcha Love\"). For a supposedly introspective record, it feels strikingly sanitary—like a centrifuge of sounds and words that are often associated with romance and self-discovery, without the depth of yearning that leads us to understand why these feelings matter. As an album, it feels complete but transient: True Romance has the capacity to lift and inspire, but that feeling doesn’t linger.\n",

      "Compressing reviewId 20008 with content It’s hard to think of a genre better suited for compilations than footwork. Comps let tracks exist as individual entities in a set, related not by some overarching narrative but through action and reaction. The setting reinforces the inherent kineticism of music often made by former dancers, and the sharp turns required to keep the dancefloor competitive (what some listeners find exhausting about footwork is part of what keeps it vital—that shark-like need to keep moving or die). Above all else, though, the compilation format honors the sense of community embedded in footwork’s DNA: this is music meant to be made and experienced together. In 2014, no one embodies that communal spirit more than Teklife, the (mostly) Chicago-based crew of producers and DJs and the driving force behind footwork’s gradual expansion from a regional to global phenomenon. Even Double Cup— the game-changing 2013 solo album from Teklife founder and scene ambassador DJ Rashad, widely understood as the genre’s finest full-length release—was a family affair; of the album’s 14 tracks, 12 were collaborative.Rashad passed away suddenly this April, at age 34 and in the prime of his career. His name appears only once on the tracklist, but his legacy is the lifeblood of Next Life, a memorial collection of new works presented by Teklife and long-standing footwork advocate Hyperdub. (Proceeds from the album go entirely to Rashad's son, Chad.) Rashad’s one official contribution, \"OTS\", isn’t the most immediately gripping of the album, though it does hit the sweet spot between his two best modes: bare-bones, chant-driven booty house and heady, melody-oriented Rhodes workouts, at times firmly grounded on the dancefloor and at times levitating just above it. But even the track itself is a collaborative effort, joined by Teklife heavy hitters and close friends DJ Spinn, DJ Manny, and Taso. In any other sphere, a single track by four distinct producers might read as a little absurd; in Teklife, where the joy of collaboration is its own reward, that’s just how it goes.Lest we forget, this is still \"the Chi, the city of hella haters,\" a phrase coined by Kanye West in 2007 on Consequence album cut \"Grammy Family\" but expressed a thousand times over elsewhere in Chicago over the years. It’s a city fractured by design, its system of geographic and socioeconomic segregation in place since the Great Migration and exacerbated in the 2000s by the failure of the most extreme public housing redevelopment project in American history. Culturally, the result is an archipelagic cluster of subcultures that often never grow beyond their niche; even when scenes thrive, they don’t often spread. Combine that with Chicago’s lingering reputation as cultural fly-over territory, despite decades of musical history to the contrary. There’s a prevailing tinge of dread among musicians in the area, that there isn’t enough light for everyone to get shine here and even less money to make your art profitable, feeding a bitter undercurrent of competitiveness that courses quietly beneath Chicago’s music scene. Within this context especially, the brotherhood that animates and unifies the tracks compiled on Next Life cannot be overstated.Even considered outside of its sentimental context, it’s a strong collection, on par with either of the scene-surveying Bangs & Works compilations that introduced footwork to dance music aesthetes worldwide in the early 2010s. It’s bittersweet, but the void left by Rashad leaves room for a closer look at Teklife’s less heralded new guard and veterans whose legacies have yet to be fully acknowledged. DJ Earl and DJ Taye, two of the crew’s youngest members and the most promising of footwork’s second generation, shine on \"Do This Again\", striking a balance between familiarity and innovation. Scene pioneers Traxman and RP Boo, credited for inventing footwork as we know it, thrive at the other end of the spectrum; Traxman’s \"Sit Ya Self Down\" is a particularly refined example of his breed of tender kitsch, and Boo’s \"That’s It 4 Lil Ma\" is efficiently deranged, overwhelming with a bare minimum of components. \"Jungle Juke\" is a straight shot of unwarped, 140-BPM ghetto house, true to form for fellow trailblazer Gant-Man, who beat Planet Mu to the punch by five years in 2005 with his official remix of Beyoncé’s \"Check On It\", effectively juke’s major label debut. DJ Manny, another of the crew’s founders despite his young age and a permanent fixture on practically every major Teklife release, delivers one of the album’s best moments on \"Harvey Ratchet\", a masterful streamlining of his vocal-oriented sampling style.Next Life closes with \"U Should No\", an ecstatically campy finale that repeatedly devolves from disco-ready four-on-the-floor into stuttering free-for-all. It’s an interesting gesture: three out-of-towners and relative Teklife rookies (DJ Paypal is from North Carolina, Feloneezy and Jackie Dagger hold down Belgrade’s surprisingly devoted footwork scene) deliver the closing statement that nudges your attention back towards Chicago’s house music history.If there’s one glaring difference between this collection and the Bangs & Works surveys, it’s the inclusion of artists outside the Chicago city limits; elsewhere on the album are contributions from New York duo Tripletrain and New York-via-UK producer Durban. As footwork has grown into a national movement, with Teklife members regularly touring overseas and releases often distributed by British labels, long-time fans and purists have worried that the genre’s rawness might become diluted or glamorously re-touched. Instead, Teklife’s steady globalization has only strengthened the movement. There has been no re-packaging of the crew’s original appeal. Considering that reappropriation has always been central to the sample-heavy art—absorbing and recontextualizing influences, drawing cross-genre parallels or simply fucking stuff up—the increasing exposure to new sounds has only made the music more interesting. Where mid-'00s footwork was rife with hip-hop and soul inflections, Next Life (and much of Teklife’s output from the last few years) incorporates bits of jungle and d'n'b just as deftly.The word \"forward-thinking\" is often tossed around when discussing footwork; Next Life makes a case that \"outward-thinking\" might be a more accurate way to put it. The movement’s trajectory in recent years hasn’t been linear so much as expansive, a three-dimensional broadening of horizons. Certainly the music is futuristic, but that doesn’t entirely capture what’s most exciting about footwork in 2014: that the insatiable curiosity of the Teklife crew has thrown into high gear a \"Katamari Damacy\"-style mode of folding new cultural touchstones into their established sound, keeping footwork’s essence intact but constantly evolving. More than anything, Next Life is a testament to footwork’s endless possibilities—proof that there’s no one \"right way\" to do this stuff, even as it expands well beyond its original context. There couldn’t be a better way to honor the memory of the guy who understood its limitless potential more than anyone.\n",

      "Compressing reviewId 19860 with content \"World domination is what I want for Sleater-Kinney.\" I am wont to believe Carrie Brownstein when the Sleater-Kinney guitarist, then 21, qualified this 1996 assertion by shrugging it off as a joke. She was, in all likelihood, alluding to the mainstream-affixed mantra of Seattle's blown-up grunge scene, which her own band's roots in the nearby punk-feminist community of Olympia opposed. Like Bikini Kill and Fugazi before them, Sleater-Kinney would never succumb to the beckoning of major labels. And in 1996, with their crass punk insurrectionism, the idea of mass success was laughable. Of course, Brownstein's reputation for regional parody on \"Portlandia\" now precedes her. \"We're never going to be huge like Pearl Jam or something,\" she said in that interview, \"but I want more people to have access to our music, not just the geeky kids.\" Seven years later, in 2003, during the beginnings of the Iraq War, Sleater-Kinney played its first of many arena-sized gigs—on tour with Pearl Jam.From 1994 to 2006, Sleater-Kinney seemed to have it all. The trio of Brownstein, singer-guitarist Corin Tucker, and (from '96 on) drummer Janet Weiss created and then fervently revised one of the most distinctive sounds in rock: The friction of their overlapping voices—Brownstein's monotone speak-sing anchoring Tucker's wild vibrato—had an ecstatic, unusual beauty. The expressive longing of Tucker's alone was a gift, like Kathleen Hanna's hardcore holler aspiring to the quasi-operatics of Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson. Tucker is perhaps the first punk singer to attempt such a thing while worshipping the enormity of, say, Aretha Franklin, channeling lessons from the Queen of Soul into her own singing, holding onto moments for dear life and then projecting them to the heavens, becoming Queen of Rock.In practice, Sleater-Kinney were humble, imageless indie-rockers; in song, they demanded icon status. This streamlined set, Start Together, captures that dichotomy, archiving the Sleater-Kinney canon with care: from the ideological-punches of thirdwave feminism to their post-riot grrrl classic rock revisionism, all seven albums have been remastered and paired with a plainly gorgeous hardcover photobook, as well as the surprise of a reunion-launching 7\" single. In all, Start Together tells the unlikely story of how this band carried the wildfire of '90s Oly-punk to pastures of more ambitious musicality—a decade that moves from caterwauling shrieks to glowing lyricism, from barebones snark to Zep-length improv, from personal-political to outright (left) political.Sleater-Kinney was consciously about rock'n'roll. Lou Reed sang for Jenny whose life was saved by rock; Ramones told us how Sheena became a punk. In 1994 there was no shortage of women plugging in—newly born classics included Hole's Live Through This, Liz Phair's Exile in Guyville, PJ Harvey's Rid of Me, the Breeders' Last Splash—but the lineage of larger-than-life stars, the deified behind-the-head-shredders, still had few instances of women delivering rock-as-saviour meta-narratives themselves. Sleater-Kinney turned the machismo of hippie-blooded '60s and '70s rock on its head: covers of Springsteen and CCR, homages to Kinks and the Clash, Brownstein's Pete Townshend windmills and shin-kicking swagger, Tucker's defiant declaration that \"I make rock'n'roll!\" A life-or-death seriousness is omnipresent with Sleater-Kinney, but they never rejected rock's base desires—sex, dancing, proverbial milkshakes—although sometimes they vaguely mocked them. Sleater-Kinney stole from men what men had in turn stolen from the margins: electrified blues that all still made girls scream.The first Sleater-Kinney practice was in March of 1994. It was the spring that Kurt Cobain died. Hindsight paints it clear: Cobain's desire for a future-rock made by women dispersed into the universe. Brownstein and Tucker did Sleater-Kinney as a side-project to their respective bands, the queercore power-chord screams of Excuse 17 and soul-baring punk of Heavens to Betsy. Sleater-Kinney fused these politicized sounds, but as they grew—with affection for B-52's shimmy and Sonic Youth cool—they never let the punk rulebook limit their vision. Riot grrrl was fragmenting and they learned from its successes and failures—a radical streak pervaded their writerly Hüsker Dü-type storytelling—but they also fought to not be removed from the context of their foundation. The wiry blast of 1995's Sleater-Kinney is as good an indicator of Bikini Kill's influence as any feminist album since, echoing their sound as well as an interest in making punk become activism.The debut is foremost a rejection of heteronormative sex, as Tucker and Brownstein were reckoning with life inside their bodies as women who approached sexuality fluidly. There's a song about how much sucking dick sucks, called \"How to Play Dead\"—it began Sleater-Kinney's mission of showing how society can silence women and minimize their problems. The urgency is real; all of Sleater-Kinney was scrappily-recorded in one night, on a trip to Australia, where they enlisted drummer Lora MacFarlane, who also kept-time on 1996's Call the Doctor. \"A Real Man\" is like an incendiary take on classic feminist text The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm: \"Don't you wanna feel it inside/ They say that it feels so nice,\" Tucker gasps with visceral sarcasm. Call it clit-rock, I guess; over hard-style riffs, Tucker makes it clear she won't wait \"to cum every time.\" Amid this whirlwind of pleasure and pain, which occasionally veers towards emo, Brownstein and Tucker's whispers erupt on \"The Day I Went Away\", one of two wistful songs that foreshadow Sleater-Kinney's impending greatness.Sleater-Kinney continued feeding its appetite for destruction of archetypes on 1996's Call the Doctor. It improved their raw punk convictions in every way: more complex guitarwork, more distortion to intellectualize, more aggression and profound sadness. \"Why do good things never wanna stay?\" Tucker asks on \"Good Things\", an earnest stomach-twister of a teardrop tune, while the dire \"Anonymous\" wonders why its female protagonist is voluntarily unspoken. \"I Wanna Be Your Joey Ramone\" uses tradition to infiltrate and subvert—the riff could be Ramones pushing Stooges' \"I Wanna Be Your Dog\" into the red—to cleverly protest the worship of male icons and spur revolution: \"I wanna be your Joey Ramone/ Pictures of me on your bedroom door/ Invite you back after the show/ I'm the queen of rock and roll.\" It's a two-and-half-minute rock'n'roll joyride deserving of a gender studies thesis.Tucker's fierce and vulnerable depictions of unconventional love marked the title track, where the dueling vocals first exploded. \"It felt like something had opened up,\" Brownstein told Rolling Stone. \"We just stopped. And [Corin] was like, ‘This is so awesome, you have to keep doing that.’ It felt like I had fused with her. This bolt of lightning had gone from my chest to hers.\" Call the Doctor landed at number three on The Village Voice’s then-influential critic’s poll. Their label, Chainsaw, couldn’t press copies fast enough.Then, behold: Janet Weiss. She joined on 1997's breakneck Dig Me Out, an all-time great American punk statement, giving Sleater-Kinney the most crucial muscle a drummer can offer: not sheer force, but heart, taking the momentum to a new plane. Sleater-Kinney released their next four records with the larger Olympia feminist label, Kill Rock Stars, but none distilled the band's sound and attitude like Dig Me Out: sometimes brutal heartache, sometimes a menacing threat, always intelligent and extreme, there are enough hooks architected into these two- and three-minute songs to span several albums, but even the added dum-de-dum sugar seems as though it must be raw Portland agave.\"Little Babies\" critiques stereotypes of motherhood, \"Heart Factory\" roars over synthetic emotions of the Prozac Nation, and the instantly classic \"Words and Guitar\" is an ode to rock that just feels necessary. At the peak of \"The Drama You've Been Craving\"—Tucker's \"Kick it OUT!\"—there are practically fireworks bursting on either side. Really, Dig goes from 0-to-100 within seconds of its opening salvo of a title track, which begs for transcendence from worldly oppression, \"Outta this mess/ Outta my head.\" Unlike so much in the trajectory of punk, there is no nihilistic self-destruction in the face of chaos. More than skepticism, anti-consumerism, or the glories of tattoo art, punk teaches empathy, a principle Sleater-Kinney practiced with nuance. This is why Sleater-Kinney's music shines a light despite its loudness, why it is easy to be alone with the songs and feel protected. Sleater-Kinney would never forego the optimism to believe their songbook could make us smarter, angrier, more tender and hopeful. Dig Me Out dreams of a better future, clawing itself up with every note.The highlight of Dig Me Out and Sleater-Kinney's career, \"One More Hour\" is one of the most devastating break-up songs in rock. \"Oh, you've got the darkest eyes,\" Tucker and Brownstein quaver in unison—the song is about their own short-lived romance—and the way Tucker extends the last word, it is like she can't let them go. There are complex feelings near clear ones, which is what break-ups are: someone wants to untangle the mess, someone wants to snip it apart. \"I needed it,\" Tucker howls, hardly distinguishing where one word ends and another begins. \"One More Hour\" is sublime sadness, a kind one can only know when staring at the end of something and wanting desperately for it not to be so. This feeling would root 1999's atmospheric The Hot Rock: subdued and spiritual, it served a number of firsts for Sleater-Kinney, among them a slot on the Billboard charts (at 181). Tucker, Brownstein, and Weiss had never sounded so introspective, existential, and dark, so aesthetically poetic and conventionally pretty. The album's interlocking parts were influenced by the gentle alterna-pop of Go-Betweens and Yo La Tengo; voices intertwine gracefully, as if braiding together dreams and wounds. It's the Sleater-Kinney record you're most likely to play on a train while gazing out the window and getting lost in thought.Brownstein and Tucker sang of personal becoming, the uncertainties of adulthood, dying relationships and technological paranoia—it was, after all, the year before tin-foil Y2K Bugs would signal the end civilization—sometimes with abstract metaphors. The jaw-dropping despair of Brownstein's wearied ballad \"The Size of Our Love\" has a lonely ambience, a love-story plaintively set between hospital walls: \"The ring on my finger/ So tight it turns blue,\" she sings over a crying viola. \"A constant reminder/ I'll die in this room/ If you die in this room.\" It's unsurprising that Brownstein has since catapulted her storylines to a mass scale: Comedians are professionals at manipulating our emotions, and if it is one's intention to make people laugh, it must help to have mastered the ability to make them cry.The sun, ocean, and cosmos build the imagistic single, \"Get Up\". A staccato riff quilts the emphatic drumming, and the guitar tones are magic—had the band not called those natural elements out, it's evident that \"Get Up\" absorbed their expanses. Tucker's hovering speak-sing evokes Kim Gordon beaming down from an imagined heaven on Sonic Youth's \"Tunic (Song for Karen)\". Echoing Patti Smith as well, Tucker's words fly into the air as if given wings—\"Goodbye small hands/ Goodbye small heart/ Goodbye small head\"—zen-like as she watches her body go, \"like a whole bucket of stars dumped into the universe.\" Sleater-Kinney didn't necessarily follow their '60s rock predecessors into ashram training, but this reflects the Eastern belief that when you die, you become a part of nature. Tucker works through primal desires—\"Do you think I'm an animal? Am I not?\"—and despite the textured makeover, The Hot Rock emerges as one of Sleater-Kinney's heaviest records.Swinging back to capital-R Rock, 2000's All Hands on the Bad One was Sleater-Kinney's most straight-ahead arbiter of thirdwave feminism and also, surprisingly, their most jovial record. Sing-song guitar-pop turned up alongside plainspoken take-downs of sexism in music, and hints of new wave, girl-groups and Go-Gos mixed (cohesively, too) with some of their hardest whiplash-rippers. The enormously hooky \"You're No Rock n' Roll Fun\" taunts dry girl-averse indie snobs: \"You're no rock'n'roll fun/ Like a piece of art that no one can touch!\" the trio sang together, throwing \"whiskey drinks and chocolate bars\" at these guys to shake up the mood, 'cause why not? When Sleater-Kinney note how \"the best man won't hang out with the girl BAA-AAND!\" we're only left wondering why he'd pass on such fun.Similar humor plays out on \"Milkshake n' Honey\", a Spinal Tap-esque wink at the debauched rocker/groupie complex, but the incisive messages make the best songs: \"The Professional\" uses charged surf-punk to condemn the marginalizing of women in music, \"Male Model\" dismantles the sexist canon and rejects investigations of women's authenticity. A lyrics sheet proves Bad One is Sleater-Kinney's most direct sloganeering, but it doesn't come off as such; Tucker's ferocity and Brownstein's French-sung interjections make it cool, even. \"#1 Must Have\" is the centerpiece, in which Tucker dissects the commodification of riot grrrl and—in light of the rapes at Woodstock in '99—powerfully asserts, \"The number one must-have/ Is that we are safe.\" The song's lasting relevance can't be overstated.The world was irreversibly changed by the time of 2002's One Beat, Sleater-Kinney's weightiest record. Adventuring with math rock and stomping horns, it was their most explicitly political album, grappling with the aftermath of 9/11 on \"Far Away\" and \"Combat Rock\". These songs reflected the national headspace as selflessly as any act of using someone's tragedy for art allows. Tucker questioned the all-or-nothing patriotism sweeping the U.S., and detailed her own experience that day with raw catharsis, calling-out the hidden President Bush, honoring those who served, and striving for a glimmer of kindness: \"I look to the sky/ And ask it not to rain.\" One Beat was not all war songs—the bouncy organ-led love-anthem \"Oh!\" had glammy inflections, \"Prisstina\" chronicled an outcast's discovery of rock. The closer, \"Sympathy\", rips instrumentation from \"Sympathy for the Devil\" but inverts its theme, a prayer for the life of Tucker's premature-born child: \"There is no righteousness in your darkest moment,\" Tucker belts, \"We're all equal in the face of what we're most afraid.\"Even the scope of One Beat couldn't predict Sleater-Kinney's monstrous phase-one farewell, 2005's The Woods. The band's appeal had become that of the indie rock mainstream, and a suburban high-schooler (such as myself, then) could readily learn of The Woods' greatness from the same weirdo dude-friends who repped new CDs by Queens of the Stone Age, the White Stripes, and Wilco (like I did). Sleater-Kinney had just played arenas with Pearl Jam, bending notes into heavier, looser sounds, when they journeyed upstate New York to track The Woods with producer David Fridmann, himself only two years removed from helping turn Flaming Lips' 2002 opus Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots into a wider breakout.When your best work is also your most uncompromising and unintelligible, you have accomplished a considerable artistic feat—this was the The Woods. It was tracked live with more distortion than usual, giving it a freneticism, a deranged euphoria. \"[Friddman would] say things to Janet like, 'Play like Keith Moon, but Keith Moon with a blanket coming down over him,'\" Tucker said. That possessed orchestra-of-rhythm translated. The album's heaving 11-minute mega-solo, \"Let's Call It Love\", and the soulful echo \"Night Light\", comprise a grandiose jam colored in Deep Purple. Zep riffs abound. \"Entertain\" is an atypical military march, declaring war on hollow retro rock; its \"woah-oh-ohs\" are more like shields than exaltations. \"You come around looking 1984/ You're such a bore, 1984/ Nostalgia, you're using it like a whore\"—Brownstein's Orwellian invocation opposes this music with a far more poetic dismissal than \"Fuck Interpol.\" Sleater-Kinney's first six records gave a lens through which we might imagine a feminist rewrite of classic rock; The Woods is a front-row seat.\"Jumpers\" was inspired by a New Yorker piece on suicides at the Golden Gate Bridge—\"the intensity of feeling that you can't find meaning in your life, so you need to find meaning in your death,\" Brownstein said—which oddly befit the band's decision to end on top. \"Modern Girl\" is Sleater-Kinney's most timeless song, impressionistic as closing one's eyes and staring at the brightest star: \"My whole life was like a picture of a sunny day,\" Brownstein sings, like Sleater-Kinney's \"Yesterday\". But embedded in the soft twinkle is a critique of the consumer culture Sleater-Kinney resisted. (They despised the new proposition of a career-shifting iPod commercial.) The band stopped just as independent music was becoming more financially significant—2004 was the year future indie-Grammy-holders Arcade Fire landed—but traditional notions of integrity were also growing complicated. Brownstein was strangely prophetic: \"I took my money/ And bought me a TV/ TV brings me closer to the world.\" This is music you make when you can sense it's one more hour 'til the walls close in.Little is concrete in rock'n'roll—at the very least, its pivotal moments have often been shrouded in discrepancy and myth. Sister Rosetta Tharpe was the first guitar hero; no, Robert Johnson. Pete Townshend's guitar-smashing was auto-destructive art; no, Townshend's wrecked guitar was privilege. Elvis is dead; Elvis is in Las Vegas. Punk started in London—no, New York—girls started punk rock, not England. But there are unequivocal truths of Sleater-Kinney's career. Objectively, the trio was born of riot grrrl, an underground band that started with two girls together in a living room and became the movement's greatest critical success and so much more: an initial seven-album streak worthy of setting in stone eternal. There is an overcast art-print that accompanies Start Together, set at a weathered race track: Tucker is pounding pavement with a raised fist, Weiss is caught in a fierce skip, and Brownstein, in the middle, has both arms extended skyward, cracking a smile as if she just crushed a marathon. In reality, the band was only just beginning. Sleater-Kinney look invincible there, triumphant even, like superheroes, and if Start Together proves a thing, it is that with passion, persistence, and unwavering purpose, ordinary people can become them.\n",

      "Compressing reviewId 19463 with content Will Saul’s been around for more than a decade now, but in recent years the Glastonbury producer/DJ’s profile reached new levels of visibility. He started the Simple imprint in 2003 and three years later launched Aus with help from Cornwall musician Fin Greenall. Both labels continue to release material, but Aus in particular has developed into one of the UK’s most notable house/techno imprints. At its best, Aus has served as a breeding ground for promising talent, and even its lesser releases over the last few years have lent the label a reputation for consistency.Aus and Simple have released their share of floor-driven bangers but both tip towards subtlety, and that extends to Saul’s own work as a producer and DJ. In the former guise, he’s worked infrequently and under his own name; last year, he released a solo album as Close, Getting Closer, that mixed conventional melodic form with slow-burn pacing while yielding two club jams, “Beam Me Up” and “OSCAR”. The approach extends to his DJ work. Although sections of his 3xCD Balance mix in 2009 showed his skill with uptempo pyrotechnics, elsewhere he’s favored a more patient structure. This was none more apparent than on his contribution to BBC radio’s Essential Mix series last year, which found him leaning on key players from his labels’ rosters to create a mix that relied more on mood than immediacy.His latest mix, for !K7’s esteemed DJ-Kicks series, continues in that vein, with Saul tapping frequent Aus and Simple contributors for unreleased cuts and showing off some of the label’s more notable recent releases over the course of its 80-minute runtime. His feel for composition hasn't diminished; the mix’s first 12 minutes move by at a slow climb, setting a gradually evolving mood. Things finally pick up during the back half of head-in-the-clouds Berlin techno producer Youandewan’s “Ego”, which develops from a wet pound into a spinning array of soft-focus tones. \"Ego\" has the feel of a track that transforms the mix into something greater, but instead it transitions into Jabru and Joel Culpepper’s ”Church”, a sultry, shuffling vocal tune that sounds nice enough but would’ve fit better alongside Getting Closer’s avant-pop stylings.Last year, Spanish deep-house producer John Talabot’s own entry in the DJ-Kicks series proved it was possible to create a forceful document that unraveled with a slow, psychedelic feel; so the relative stasis of Saul’s entry is, on one level, a letdown. While its stilted, dreamy sense of pacing is easy enough to get lost in, it’s even easier to tune out entirely. Still, engaging stretches abound: Swedish house producer and co-head of the playful Studio Barnhus imprint Axel Boman impresses with the wobbly, crisp-light “Dubbel (Dub)”, while the mix’s final third locks into a satisfactorily consistent groove cemented by Saul’s ruddy gear workout “Pedal Power” and Dutch weirdo Legowelt’s watery, aptly named “Ethereal Techno Music Will Never Die”.Of the three roles Saul plays, his talents as curator are most evident, and so the best moments of his DJ-Kicks installment are from artists who’ve made their name, partially or entirely, through releases on his labels. Irish duo Bicep, who have achieved a startling level of consistency over the last few years, return with the skipping, high-octane “Nova”, while George FitzGerald, one of house music’s rising talents, comes through with a big-room sheen and computerized vocals on “Wanting Needing”. Depending on where you looked, FitzGerald’s tunes were all anyone could talk about in 2013; this year, that title belongs to Leon Vynehall, whose Music for the Uninvited showcased an appealing, tasty approach to house. His contribution to Saul’s DJ-Kicks, “Time”, is out of step with his usual jacking fare and all the better for it, a wistful slice of body music that wields subtlety with a steady hand. The lovely, subdued “Time” is a prime example of the type of refined dance music Saul’s expertly curated over the last decade or so; his DJ-Kicks mix could use more moments like it, but the highlights compiled here nonetheless speak to Saul’s excellent taste, as well as a reminder of why Aus and Simple have been worth following. \n",

      "Compressing reviewId 19092 with content Drop into random sections of the two-and-a-half-hour long block that is 10 Years of Full Pupp and you're liable to hear very different sounds. Some will resemble 1970s psychedelia a la the Steve Miller Band; some the breastbeating passions of Depeche Mode; some New Age, some disco with the flamboyance toned down and sequined unitards replaced by breathable hemp tees. Everything feels engineered for a kind of stoned wonder, like something you might encounter during an evening show at the planetarium.Pigeonholed as \"space disco\"—a term addressing the idea that this is music people might want to dance or relax to in equal measure—the truth of the music is, as is often the case, messier and less catchy. \"When I started playing out again around '93, I didn't know any other way to do it than to mix it up,\" Pupp's founder, Prins Thomas, once said. \"I was playing stuff from Bitches Brew together with early acid house and Beatles instrumentals.\" That nobody vaudeville-hooked him off the stage with a cane suggests he was onto something, and in the intervening years, Pupp became known as a place less concerned with the orthodoxy of house and techno than with all the genres that surround them, constellated like stars in playful, inventive ways.10 Years is divided into two mixes edited by Thomas, half old material and half new, blended together. For those who have been paying attention, some of these names will be familiar: Thomas, diskJokke, Blackbelt Andersen, Casiokids, Øyvind Morken, Andre Bratten—none of them besides Thomas having strong individual recognition but all friends at the party, releasing a single or two a year and the occasional album. A few entries—Randaberg Ego Ensemble's \"You Can't Do It Right,\" for example—are by artists who haven't put out anything since 2007, and have only ever released with Full Pupp. The impression here is more of a community than a business, of sly Norwegians twisting out their troubles in the dark.These mixes are good companions. The tempos are closer to walking pace than anything else, and the occasional climax fizzes away like mist. It's slow compared to a lot of techno but rarely feels heavy, in part because it spends a good amount of time laughing. Amidst the serious prog-rock intimations of the void are boing-boing noises and Copacabana beats to remind you that the first thing on their agenda is fun—as is the second and likely the third, if they have not thrown the agenda in the trash by now or gotten it messy with cake. (Todd Terje, who also tends to serve his epiphanies with a joke, released his first singles with Full Pupp, and is missed. Note also that \"pupp\" in Norwegian means \"tit,\" though what \"full tit\" means is a question best enjoyed by the imagination.)\"If you play within the style of techno than you have to be really good, because there's a lot of really good techno DJs,\" Thomas once said in an interview, adding, \"I'm more like a piano bar entertainer.\" Like Terje and several of his other peers, Thomas comes off like a goofball who uses self-deprecation to avoid how boring it can be to bear your soul and have others bear theirs to you. His sleight of hand is that he's more clever than he lets on. \n"
